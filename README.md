Optimal EV Charging Station Planning in Transportation and Power Networks

We developed an optimization model in GAMS for the optimal placement and sizing of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, considering both transportation and distribution networks. The model combines traffic flow analysis with power system constraints, such as voltage profiles, line loading, and transformer capacities. It includes both linear and nonlinear components to more accurately capture the real-world behavior of the grid and charging demand. The model minimizes the total system cost while ensuring service reliability and grid feasibility.
